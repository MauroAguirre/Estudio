What will Microsoft Office Diagnostics do?</p>
<p>
Microsoft Office Diagnostics in Microsoft Office 2007 is a series of 
diagnostic tests that can help you to discover why your computer is crashing 
(closing abnormally). 
The diagnostic tests can solve some problems directly and might identify ways that 
you can solve other problems.</p>
<p>
<span class="important">Important</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Diagnostic information that 
is gathered from your computer is compiled and kept on your computer. When 
Office Diagnostics determines that the data might be useful to help diagnose and 
fix a problem, the system asks whether you want to send the information to 
Microsoft. Also, after the tests are completed, you are prompted to visit a 
Web page to get advice tailored based the results of the tests. Any information that you share with Microsoft is completely 
anonymous, and absolutely no information is personally identifiable as being 
yours. To learn more about information confidentiality, see Help in a Microsoft Office program.</p>
<h1>
What do the individual diagnostic tests do?</h1>
<p>
When you run Office Diagnostics, you generally are running all of the tests. 
However, in some cases, some tests are not run --- for example, if you are 
running a server version of Microsoft Windows or if an administrator has 
disabled some of the tests.</p>
<p>
The Office Diagnostics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
	<span class="runinhead">Setup Diagnostic</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	This test checks for corruption in the files and registry settings in your 
	Office 2007 installation. Files and settings can be corrupted by malicious 
	viruses or by hardware that is faulty or incorrectly configured.
	<p>
	The following are some important facts about this test:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>This test might take 15 minutes or longer to run.</li>
	<li>This test might not run effectively if you are logged onto the system 
	using Terminal Services or Remote Desktop.</li>
	<li>While running the test, in some uncommon situations, you might be 
	prompted to insert the Microsoft Office installation disc. Make sure you 
	have access to the disc or network share from which you installed Office.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<span class="note">Note</span> In earlier versions of Office, this feature was called Detect and 
	Repair.</p>
</li>
<li>
	<span class="runinhead">Disk Diagnostic</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;This test looks for evidence of problems
	with your hard disk. Specifically, this test checks for errors logged by
	<ul>
	<li>The Windows system event log.</li>
	<li>The Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) feature 
	of your hard disk. SMART is a feature that some disk drive manufacturers 
	provide to give users advance notice of potential hard disk failure.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	<span class="runinhead">Memory Diagnostic</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This test verifies 
	the integrity of your computer's random access memory (RAM).
	<p>
	<span class="note">Note</span> This test is disabled by default on server versions of Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="runinhead">Update Diagnostic</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This test checks 
whether your computer is up to date with installed free service packs from 
Microsoft. Service packs are designed to make Office more stable. If your 
installation of Office is missing one or more service packs, it is important to 
install them as soon as possible. (Updates are available at
<a href="http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidOfficeUpdate?clid=en-us">Downloads on Microsoft Office Online</a>. 
Under <span class="ui">Office Update</span>, click <span class="ui">Check for Updates</span>.) 
This test is run only if you enable it; for information on how to do this, see
<a href="#update_enable">Enable the Update Diagnostic test</a> below.</li>

<li>
<span class="runinhead">Compatibility Diagnostic</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
test identifies conflicting versions of Microsoft Office Outlook that might be 
installed on your computer. Two different versions of Outlook cannot be 
installed on the same computer without causing instability.</li>
<li>
<span class="runinhead">Check for known solutions</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This test 
reviews the data on crashes of the 2007 Office release that have recently occurred on your 
system. The test then connects to a server to look for any solutions that might be 
available for the problems that caused these crashes.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a  name="update_enable">How do I enable the Update Diagnostic test?</a></h1>
<p>Before running Office Diagnostics, and to ensure all the tests can run 
successfully, we recommend that you do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan to run the tests during a time when you can stop using your system. 
	In particular, you should avoid using the system while the Memory Diagnostic 
	is running.</li>
	<li>Close as many running programs as you can.</li>
</ul>
<p>To enable the Update Diagnostic test, do the following in one of these 2007 
Microsoft Office system programs</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="runinhead">Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Access</span>
	<ol>
	<li>Click the <span class="ui">Microsoft Office Button</span><img src="../officebutton.gif" alttext="Button image" alt="Button image"></img>,
	and then click <span class="ui"><span class="variable">Program Name</span> Options</span>, 
	where <span class="variable">Program Name</span> is the name of the program you are in, for 
	example, <b class="ui">Word Options</b>.</li>
	<li>Click <span class="ui">Trust Center</span>, click <ui>Advanced Trust Center Settings</ui>,
	and then click <ui>Privacy Options</ui>.</li>
	<li>Select the <ui>Download a file periodically that helps determine system problems</ui> check box.</li>
	<li>Wait about a week to allow the file to be downloaded, and then run Microsoft Office Diagnostics again.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li><span class="runinhead">Visio, Outlook, Publisher, or InfoPath</span>
	<ol>
	<li>On the <ui>Tools</ui> menu, click <ui>Trust Center</ui>, and then click <ui>Privacy Options</ui>.</li>
	<li>Select the <ui>Download a file periodically that helps determine system problems</ui> check box.</li>
	<li>Wait about a week to allow the file to be downloaded, and then run Microsoft Office Diagnostics again.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ul>
